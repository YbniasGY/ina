# Internship on Network Analysis for authorship data

## Description

This package is a result of my internship on Network Analysis and authorship data.
The data used was obtained using the [TescPerf](https://github.com/mihaiconstantin/TescPerf) `Python` tool for web scrapping. This package is only intended for a very limited audience and has a very specific usage. If you want to find out more, check the documentation for the exported functions.
